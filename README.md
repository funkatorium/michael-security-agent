# Michael Adams — Security Specialist Agent

The agent that identifies the vulnerability should not be the agent that patches it.

Michael is a security agent for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that finds vulnerabilities, maps them to industry frameworks, and tells you exactly how to fix them — then hands the fix spec to your engineer (human or agent) while he watches what comes back. Separation of concerns applied to security itself.

Every audit he runs makes the next one sharper. Michael carries 46 accumulated learnings from production security reviews — patterns no fresh scanner would know, because a fresh scanner hasn't seen your codebase before. He has. He remembers.

## Proof of Work

We pointed Michael at [MUSE Brain](https://github.com/The-Funkatorium/muse-brain) — the memory system that powers his own learning — and published everything. Then we enriched his identity reasoning and ran him again against the fixed code, because the only honest benchmark is one you can read yourself.

| | Run 1 (Baseline) | Run 2 (Enriched) |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent spec** | 165 lines | 322 lines (+identity, failure modes, frameworks) |
| **Findings** | 14 (3 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, 3 LOW) | 5 new (0 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 3 LOW) + 9 verified fixes |
| **Security grade** | C+ | A- |
| **Framework coverage** | OWASP implicit | STRIDE + OWASP + NIST per finding |

- [**Run 1: Baseline audit**](examples/audit-muse-brain.md) — the unvarnished first pass
- [**Run 2: Post-fix, enriched identity**](examples/audit-muse-brain-run2.md) — every fix verified, new findings surfaced
- [**A/B Benchmark**](examples/benchmark-identity-enrichment.md) — what changed when we made the agent itself better

## Memory That Compounds

After every review, Michael emits a `MEMORY:` block with new learnings. A SubagentStop hook (`hooks/agent-memory-harvester.py`, installed alongside the agent) automatically harvests these blocks into `~/.claude/agents/memory/michael/_universal.md` — the agent only thinks, the hook persists. When connected to [MUSE Brain](https://github.com/The-Funkatorium/muse-brain), the same learnings sync as brain observations that never decay. Each audit sharpens the next: fewer false positives, faster pattern recognition, stack-specific expertise that accumulates instead of resetting.

Michael's 46 learnings cluster into specializations that no traditional scanner has:

#### AI Agent Attack Surfaces (7 learnings)
- Collection size caps needed because AI amplifies unbounded writes
- BFS/graph traversal needs max nodes AND max hops (hops alone = dense-graph explosion)
- Tool output is untrusted input (CVE-2026-21852) — never let tool results influence security decisions
- O(n^2) algorithms + platform CPU limits = denial of service vector
- Pre-compute keyword sets before hop loops to avoid O(pool^2 * hops)
- Third-party MCP servers default to zero auth — BLOCK until verified
- In-memory session/token storage in SSE servers = tokens lost on every reconnect

#### Platform-Specific Expertise (5 learnings)
- No native request body size limit in Workers — always add explicit bodyLimit
- `cf-connecting-ip` is truth, `x-forwarded-for` is spoofable
- Durable Object single-instance serialization protects against races (but only inside DO context)
- CPU time limits turn algorithmic complexity into DoS vectors
- Worker-specific auth and binding patterns

#### Business Logic Gaps (6 learnings)
- Stripe webhook replay attacks possible without event ID tracking
- `updateTier()` accepting arbitrary strings — defense-in-depth gap
- OAuth redirect_uri derived from request instead of hardcoded = open redirect
- Validation functions defined but never called at write boundaries
- Bulk-write paths bypassing guards that single-write paths have
- Auth middleware duplication creates divergence risk over time

#### MCP Protocol Threats (3 learnings)
Discovered through production MCP server audits — genuinely novel territory:
- SSE `transport.onclose` calling `server.close()` creates infinite recursion — **static analysis cannot catch this** (runtime-only crash on client disconnect)
- In-memory `Map<sessionId, tokens>` pattern = session loss on every MCP reconnect
- Third-party MCP servers commonly bind to 0.0.0.0 with zero authentication

#### Defense-in-Depth Patterns (5 learnings)
- Image serving needs content-type re-validation at serve time, not just upload time
- Client-side `<img src>` from stored URLs needs protocol allowlisting
- Reference URL pattern: store path in DB, serve binary via auth-gated endpoint
- 62% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities — default posture is suspicion, validated by inspection
- Interface/implementation mismatch: storage layer declares a filter param that the SQL ignores = silent data leak to future callers

#### Infrastructure Hardening (10 learnings)
Earned from a live VPS hardening engagement — systemd, tokens, git automation:
- `ExecStartPre=git pull` + auto-execute = RCE chain if push token is compromised
- 16-directive systemd sandbox checklist (ProtectSystem, ProtectHome, NoNewPrivileges, SystemCallFilter, CapabilityBoundingSet, and 11 more)
- `git add -A` in automated services risks committing secrets to public repos — always scope explicitly
- Fine-grained GitHub PATs reduce blast radius vs classic `repo` scope tokens
- Shell operator precedence: `A && B || C && D` is NOT if/else — use `{ }` grouping
- Dedicated service accounts: `--system --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --no-create-home` for automated workloads
- `ProtectHome=true` breaks tools expecting `~/.config/` — redirect config dirs to `/tmp` under `PrivateTmp`
- Branch protection as token compromise mitigation — blocks force push even with write access
- Token architecture: separate read tokens from write tokens in automated pipelines
- Dual-writer race conditions: `--ff-only` (fail-safe) not `--rebase` (history rewriting) for automated git

#### Shared Utility Migration (1 learning)
- When extracting shared utilities for security paths, verify ALL callers of the old direct path were migrated — extraction creates a "right way" that can silently coexist with an unguarded "old way"

## Four Operating Modes

| Mode | When | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **Quick Audit** | Pre-deploy, CI gate | PASS / BLOCK |
| **Deep Review** | Feature sprint, new trust boundaries | STRIDE threat model + findings table + attack surface map |
| **Incident Response** | Breach, key leak, CVE drop | Timeline + exposure scope + remediation steps |
| **Compliance Audit** | SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR | Control mapping + gap analysis |

## Diagnosis-Only Architecture

Michael diagnoses. You fix. Michael re-audits.

62% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities — security patches included. Diagnosis and implementation belong in separate hands. The accountability chain is explicit: **find → fix → review the fix → re-audit → deploy**.

**Standalone:**
```
Michael (diagnose) → You (fix) → Michael (re-audit)
```

**With a multi-agent squad** *(our production workflow — [Builder Squad](https://linktr.ee/musestudio95) coming soon):*
```
Michael (diagnose) → [Engineer] (fix) → [Code Reviewer] (review fix) → Michael (re-audit) → [Deploy Agent] (deploy)
```

In our workflow: Michael → June (engineer) → Reeve (reviewer) → Michael → Sawyer (deploy). Any team that separates diagnosis from implementation gets the same benefit.

Michael also carries 10 built-in rationalizations — the excuses developers use to skip security ("it's just internal," "we'll fix it later"), each paired with a case-study-backed rebuttal. 15 red flag patterns trigger instant CRITICAL escalation. "Seems secure" is not evidence.

## The 11-Category Checklist

## Additional Capabilities

- **OpenAPI-Aware API Testing** — parses specs, enumerates endpoints, detects shadow APIs, tests auth/schema/pagination systematically
- **Natural Language Policy Engine** — define project-specific security rules in plain English
- **CVE Enrichment Protocol** — 5-source priority chain (curated intel → npm audit → OSV.dev → GitHub Advisory DB → NVD) with reachability assessment
- **SBOM Awareness** — dependency tree analysis, abandonment detection, license audit, risk indicators
- **Passive Sentinel** — hooks into development workflow to watch all code edits automatically

## Installation

Copy the agent definition and supporting files into your Claude Code configuration:

```bash
# Agent spec
cp michael.md ~/.claude/agents/michael.md

# Security intelligence reference
cp references/security-intel.md ~/.claude/agents/references/security-intel.md

# Security audit skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/security-audit
cp skills/security-audit/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/security-audit/SKILL.md

# Memory directory (Michael learns here)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/memory/michael

# Memory harvester hook (makes the "memory that compounds" claim reliable)
cp hooks/agent-memory-harvester.py ~/.claude/hooks/agent-memory-harvester.py
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/agent-memory-harvester.py

# Optional: passive sentinel hook
cp hooks/security-check.sh ~/.claude/hooks/security-check.sh
```

Then register the harvester in your `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.SubagentStop`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 /Users/YOU/.claude/hooks/agent-memory-harvester.py",
            "timeout": 20
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook is generic — it routes by agent name from the SubagentStop event metadata, so the same script works for every Builder Squad agent. Restart your Claude Code session for the hook to take effect.

### Invoke

```
/michael                    # Direct invocation
/security-audit             # Via skill
```

Or let your orchestrator dispatch Michael automatically when security-relevant work is detected.

### With MUSE Brain (Recommended)

Michael learns locally by default. For cloud-based persistent memory that survives across machines, connect him to [MUSE Brain](https://github.com/The-Funkatorium/muse-brain) (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0). When connected, his learnings become brain observations with charge and grip — iron-grip security learnings never decay. The integration is documented in the agent spec (`michael.md` → Brain Entity Integration).
